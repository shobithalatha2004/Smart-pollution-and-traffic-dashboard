The Smart Traffic and Pollution Dashboard is a web-based intelligent monitoring system designed to help cities manage traffic congestion and air pollution using data visualization, AI insights, and interactive analytics. It integrates real-time data from multiple sources such as sensors, APIs, and AI models to display meaningful insights about: Traffic density Pollution levels (CO₂, NO₂, PM2.5, etc.) Weather conditions Parking availability This project aims to support smart city management, providing authorities and citizens with a clear, data-driven view of urban conditions.

Objective: To monitor and visualize real-time traffic and air pollution data. To provide predictive insights using AI (Gemini API). To display key metrics like AQI (Air Quality Index), pollutant concentration, and traffic flow. To simulate traffic signal optimization and parking management. To enable smart city planning using environmental analytics.
